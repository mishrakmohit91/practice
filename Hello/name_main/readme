What does the if __name__ == "__main__": do?
To outline the basics:
The global variable, __name__, in the module that is the entry point to your program, is '__main__'.
Otherwise, it's the name you import the module by.
So, code under the if block will only run if the module is the entry point to your program.
It allows the code in the module to be importable by other modules, without executing the code block beneath
on import.
